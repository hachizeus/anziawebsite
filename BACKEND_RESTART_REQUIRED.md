# ⚠️ BACKEND SERVER MUST BE RESTARTED

## Current Issue:
You're still getting 500 errors because the backend server hasn't been restarted with the new authentication fixes.

## Solution:
**RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER:**

1. **Stop the backend server** (press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the backend)
2. **Navigate to backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. **Start the server again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## What This Will Fix:
- ✅ No more 500 errors
- ✅ Agent profile will load
- ✅ Agent properties will display
- ✅ No authentication failures
- ✅ Dashboard will work properly

## Temporary Fix Applied:
I've made the frontend more resilient - it will now show default data even if the backend fails, but **you still need to restart the backend server** for full functionality.

**The backend server MUST be restarted for all fixes to work!**
